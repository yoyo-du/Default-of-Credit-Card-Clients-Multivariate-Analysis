**STA 541 Multivariate Statistical Methods**

Multiple factor analysis (MFA) was implemented in this study to help reduce dimension and provide an informative view of multivariate data. Six different classification methods were applied in this study, which were Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Logistic Regression (LR), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Boosting Classification Tree (BCT). Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves and Area Under the ROC curve (AUC) were used in this study as the criterion to evaluate the performance of every classification model.
